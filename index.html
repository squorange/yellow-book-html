							<p>We love our clients and believe in building real, genuine relationships through the steps of their transformation journey. We feel joy when we see them grow, evolve, and achieve more than they imagined.</p>
							<p>We care a lot about impact. Providers in our industry get excited when they hit 4.0 (out of 5) on client impact or willingness to recommend. For us, hitting 4.5 is the norm. On average, we have achieved a score of 4.5+ on client impact.

			  <h2>Measuring Impact</h2>
			  <p>That's why we are rigorous in how we measure impact for our clients. Ultimately, we want our clients to reach their goals and to be successful&mdash;however they define success (financial, organizational, cultural, societal).</p>
				<p>Our Client Impact Measurement Report (CIMR) measures our impact on clients after our project ends. We have genuine conversations with senior management about the level of impact and effect our work has had on their organization.</p>
				<p>Our Workshop Feedback Scores ensure that every workshop we facilitate is held to our highest level of quality and experience. We design workshop experiences that are engaging, experiential, and transformative. We ask our workshop participants to give us feedback on how we made them feel, what they learned, and how we can improve. We measure impact by facilitator and have high internal standards for being an ‘AG-Certified Facilitator.’</p>
