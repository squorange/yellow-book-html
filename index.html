			  <p>That's why we are rigorous in how we measure for our clients.  Ultimately, we want our clients to reach their goals and to be successful - however they define success (financial, organizational, cultural, societal).  
				</p>
				<p>Our Client Impact Measurement Report (CIMR) measures our impact on clients months after our project end date.  We have genuine conversations with senior management about the level of impact and effect our work has had on their organization.  
				</p>
				<p>Our Workshop Feedback Scores ensure that every workshop we facilitate is held to our highest level of quality and experience.   We design workshop experiences that are engaging, experiential, and transformative. We ask our workshop participants to give us feedback on how we made them feel, what they learned, and how we can improve.
